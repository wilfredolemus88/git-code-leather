              <h2>Who we are!</h2>
              <p>Hello, my name is Joe Meling, owner and designer. 
                23+ has been family ran since 2013 with my wife Marti. 
                Our family grew with the addition of our son in 2014. </p>

              <h2>Hour Products</h2>
              <p>Prior to starting 23+ I had a career in rodeo which led me to my love of leatherwork.
                 I began riding calves and steers when I was six years old then stepped up to bulls at the age of twelve. 
                 Not satisfied with one event I continued adding more until I was competing in all six rodeo events in high school.

                Earning college scholarships I attended UNLV in Las Vegas and BMCC in Pendleton, OR.
                 After two trips to the CNFR (college national finals rodeo) my professional career started to take 
                 shape concentrating solely on bull riding. I represented the Columbia River Circuit twice at the Dodge 
                 National Circuit Finals and had personal best year in 2007 just missing the National Finals Rodeo by less than $1,000.  </p>
